# Step-by-Step Execution

## fd1 = open(file, O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);

- The file is opened for reading and writing (O_RDWR).

- If the file does not exist, it is created (O_CREAT).

- If the file exists, it is truncated (O_TRUNC), meaning any previous content is erased.

- The file is opened with permissions allowing the user to read and write (S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR).

- fd1 now refers to this new (or truncated) file.

## fd3 = open(file, O_RDWR);

- The file is opened again for reading and writing (O_RDWR).

- fd3 is another file descriptor referring to the same file as fd1.

## write(fd1, "Hello,", 6);

- The string "Hello," (6 bytes including the comma) is written at the beginning of the file.

- File content: Hello,

- The file offset of fd1 moves to position 6.

## write(fd2, "world", 6);

- Error! fd2 is not opened in the code snippet.

- Assuming fd2 was previously opened correctly, it writes "world" (6 bytes) at its current offset.

- If fd2's offset was also at position 6, the file content would be: Hello,world

## lseek(fd2, 0, SEEK_SET);

- Moves fd2's file pointer back to the beginning of the file.

## write(fd1, "HELLO,", 6);

- Since fd1's offset was at 6 before, it continues writing from there.

- This will overwrite the first six characters of the file with "HELLO,".

- The new file content: HELLO,world

## write(fd3, "Gidday", 6);

- fd3 shares the same file as fd1 and fd2.

- If fd3's offset was at 12, "Gidday" is written starting from there.

- Final file content: HELLO,worldGidday
