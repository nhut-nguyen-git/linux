## Explanation
- **Producer:**
  - Locks the mutex before modifying `data`.
  - Generates a random number (1â€“10) and sets `dataAvailable = 1`.
  - Signals the **consumer** and unlocks the mutex.
- **Consumer:**
  - Waits (`pthread_cond_wait`) until `producer` signals data is ready.
  - Reads the `data` and resets `dataAvailable = 0`.
  - Unlocks the mutex to allow the next iteration.
- **Synchronization:**
  - `pthread_cond_wait` allows the consumer to sleep until notified.
  - `pthread_cond_signal` wakes up the consumer when new data is available.
