## Explanation
- **Reader Threads:**
  - Acquire **read lock (`pthread_rwlock_rdlock`)**.
  - Print the shared `data` value.
  - Release **read lock (`pthread_rwlock_unlock`)**.
- **Writer Threads:**
  - Acquire **write lock (`pthread_rwlock_wrlock`)**.
  - Increment `data`.
  - Release **write lock (`pthread_rwlock_unlock`)**.
- **Synchronization Mechanism:**
  - Multiple readers can read at the same time.
  - Only one writer can modify data at a time.
  - Readers cannot read while a writer is modifying `data`.
